An emergency fund is a stash of money set aside to cover unexpected financial emergencies. For a fresher, a good goal is to save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of essential living expenses. This fund should be kept in a liquid, easily accessible savings account. It is your financial safety net. Do not invest this money in risky assets.
