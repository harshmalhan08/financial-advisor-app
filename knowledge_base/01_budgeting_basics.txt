The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting framework for beginners.
- 50% of your after-tax income should go to NEEDS. This includes rent, bills, groceries, and transportation.
- 30% of your income can be allocated to WANTS. This is for things like dining out, hobbies, vacations, and gadgets.
- 20% of your income must go to SAVINGS & DEBT REPAYMENT. This includes building an emergency fund, investing for the future, and paying off any high-interest loans.
